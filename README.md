## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of the biggest challenges while making this app was my inability to create ssl certificates that would allow me to make the API calls needed for the app to have dynamic data, instead I had to hardcode my data. this also means that the images could not be downloaded since they are also recieving ssl certificate errors whenever the http request is made.
